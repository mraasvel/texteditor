>> Todo <<

	1. Escape Sequences
		- Learn what escape sequences are and how they're defined
		- All possible ways to get them as input from the user: read in multiple bytes or just 1?
		- Like we can dispatch on ESC to read more bytes, or not

	3. Learn NCurses: set up a wrapper for whatever it's used for

		- Read input in non-canonical mode from a central point
		- Clear the screen and set up an 'editor' interface
		- Simple class like Cursor with simple functions like readCurrentPosition()

	2. Set up a basic input/output structure:

		- Store lines, data structure for lines (vector of pair of char buffers?)
		- Saving input and outputting data

	4. Cursor movement, coordinates:
		- Erase characters
		- Over a single line
		- To lines below and above
		- Scrolling beyond the end of the terminal screen
		- Screen resizing support

>> Later <<

	- Terminal settings: print out which ones were not set (generate code for getting the string based on the macro/value)
	- Compile the project using CMake instead of Make
